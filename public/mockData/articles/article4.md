## Salmonella Typhimurium from peanut butter, multistate 2008-2009
On January 8, 2009, the CDC reported an ongoing multistate outbreak of human infections due to Salmonella serotype Typhimurium, outbreaks detected in several states since November 2008. Peanut butter and peanut butter-containing products produced by the Peanut Corporation of America (PCA) plant in Blakely, Georgia, and Vitamin Cottage Natural Foods, a retailer that made peanut butter from peanuts supplied by PCA’s processing plant in Plainview, Texas, were implicated. The implicated peanut products were sold widely throughout the United States, 23 countries, and non-U.S. territories. Despite numerous product recalls, beginning in January 2009, the wide distribution of the peanut products, the long shelf life of these products, and the multiple labelings resulted in a total of 116 reported hospitalizations, and the infection might have contributed to eight deaths. A guilty verdict was subsequently issued against the CEO of the Peanut Corporation of America for the deadly outbreak.

This was an intermittent common-source outbreak, due to the wide distribution of the contaminated products.

## Source and Cause of Contamination

Former employees of Peanut Corporation described filthy conditions at the Georgia plant. Federal inspectors found roaches, rats, mold, dirt, accumulated grease, and bird droppings during their raid. They also found a leaky roof. Similar poor conditions were also found at PCA’s other processing plant in Plainview, Texas. In general, there were not enough federal inspections of food plants.

## How the Outbreak was First Discovered

On November 10, 2008, CDC’s PulseNet staff noted a small and highly dispersed multistate cluster of 13 Salmonella Typhimurium isolates with an unusual DNA fingerprint or pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) pattern reported from 12 states. Investigations by the FDA, CDC, and state health officials traced the contaminated food to a factory in Georgia operated by the Peanut Corporation of America. King Nut brand peanut butter (as sold by King Nut Company) was identified as the source of outbreaks in several states. King Nut peanut butter was not sold directly to consumers but was distributed to institutions, food service providers, food manufacturers and distributors in many states and countries.

## Patient Treatments

More than 700 people in 46 states were confirmed ill with Salmonella after consuming peanut products produced by PCA. A total of 116 patients were reported hospitalized, and the infection might have contributed to eight deaths. One of the deceased was hospitalized for two weeks, with treatment consisting of fluid rehydration to treat severe dehydration, antibiotics, and a blood transfusion after the bacteria had made it into the patient’s blood stream.

## Authority Response

In late January 2009, the FDA massively expanded the recall to every single peanut product the PCA made in the two years prior to the outbreak. On February 21, 2013, the U.S. Justice Department indicted the Peanut Corporation officials on 76 counts, including mail and wire fraud, the introduction of adulterated and misbranded food into interstate commerce with the intent to defraud or mislead, and conspiracy. Additional charges included obstruction of justice. On September 21, 2015, former PCA’s CEO, Stewart Parnell, together with his brother and partner, Michael Parnell, were sentenced to 28 and 20 years in prison, respectively, for their role in the deadly salmonella outbreak.

## Business Response

In mid-January of 2009, King Nut and Parnell’s Pride brands of peanut butter were recalled by one of its distributors, King Nut Companies, in Ohio, after an open container tested positive for salmonella bacteria. The Peanut Corporation of America followed a couple of days later with an immediate voluntary recall of 21 lots of its peanut butter, in containers ranging from five to 50 pounds, and its customers who received the recalled product were notified by telephone and in writing. This recall was initiated after an open container of King Nut brand peanut butter in a long-term care facility in Minnesota was found to contain a strain of salmonella in late December 2008, adding to cases in the community and later followed by more cases at other institutions, including nursing homes, colleges, and an elementary school. In February, PCA’s processing facility in Texas, the Plainview Peanut Company, announced that it would voluntarily suspend its operations during the food safety investigation.

## Society Response

Multiple lawsuits stemming from the national outbreak of Salmonella Typhimurium in peanut butter were filed against PCA with members of families of the sickened testifying in front of the House Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigation on February 11, 2009. The Hartford Casualty Insurer Co. sued PCA to determine the extent of its obligation and whether terms of the company’s policy exclude coverage for salmonella claims. Claims against PCA and other manufacturers were resolved, and settlements were approved in Virginia Federal Court on September 1, 2010.
