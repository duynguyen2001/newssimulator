# Clostridium perfringens, Chipotle restaurant, Ohio, 2018 

In July 2018, public health investigators at the Delaware General Health District (DGHD) and the Ohio Department of Health (ODH) investigated an outbreak of Clostridium perfringens associated with Chipotle Mexican Grill located at 9733 Sawmill Parkway in Powell, Ohio.  Six hundred and forty-seven people became ill after eating at the restaurant between July 26 and July 30. Chipotle closed the store on Monday, July 30. After implementing its food-safety-response protocols which included replacing the food and cleaning the restaurant, the facility reopened on July 31.  Lawsuits followed and in 2020 Chipotle agreed to pay $25 million to resolve criminal charges related to the company’s involvement in foodborne illness outbreaks that sickened more than 1,100 people between 2015 and 2018. 

This was a foodborne point-source outbreak.

## Source and Cause of Contamination 

While a specific item on Chipotle’s menu was not traced as the cause of contamination, the origin of the outbreak was attributed to bacteria forming on the large amounts of food, perhaps undercooked meats left out for long periods of time at unsafe temperatures.  The local health department found critical violations of local food regulations, including those specific to time and temperature controls for lettuce and beans. All sickened subjects reported eating tacos and burrito bowls. 
 
## How the outbreak was first discovered 

Health district staff identified 647 people who self-reported gastrointestinal symptoms after consuming food from the Chipotle on Sawmill Parkway between July 26 and July 30, 2018.  CDC confirmed bacteria in stool samples from Chipotle customers sickened in the outbreak. County health officials in Ohio said although food samples from a Chipotle restaurant, as well as stool samples from people who ate there, initially tested negative for Clostridium perfringens bacteria, follow-up tests by the CDC show that was what made the customers sick. 
 
## Patient Treatments 

People who were sickened reported symptoms of diarrhea and abdominal cramps.  Public health officials did not provide any information about patient age ranges or if anyone was hospitalized in this outbreak. 
 
## Authority Response 

The Delaware County and the Ohio Department of Health officials launched an investigation which included hours of phone calls and interviews along with multiple inspections. The CDC conducted food and stool testing confirming the Clostridium perfringens bacteria as the cause of the outbreak.  
 
## Business Response 
On July 30, Chipotle closed the Powell restaurant and implemented food safety response protocols that include total replacement of all food inventory and complete cleaning and sanitization of the restaurant. On August 16, Chipotle announced that it would retrain its restaurant staff nationwide on food safety 
standards. 
 
## Society Response 
Lawsuits were filed against Chipotle as early as August 2018.  In 2020, Chipotle agreed to pay $25 million to settle lawsuits related to five outbreaks caused by different pathogens between 2015 and 2018 connected to Chipotle Mexican Grill restaurants in the Los Angeles area, Boston, Virginia, and Ohio.
