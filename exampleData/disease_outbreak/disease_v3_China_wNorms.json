She was born and raised in Shanghai and pursued her medical degree at Fudan University, followed by a specialization in infectious diseases obtained from the same institution. Economically, she is stable, supported by her professional career, but she dedicates a significant portion of her income to support her aging parents, who live in a nearby district. Mei does not adhere to any particular religious beliefs but holds deep respect for traditional Chinese cultural practices. Her social life is modest, primarily consisting of close friends from her university days and colleagues from the medical community.",
