# Hepatitis A virus from green onions at Pennsylvania restaurant, 2003

In November 2003, the largest hepatitis A outbreak in U.S. history was traced back to green onions at a Chi-Chi’s restaurant at Beaver Valley Mall near Monaca, Pennsylvania, about 30 miles northwest of Pittsburgh, resulting in a total of, at least, four deaths and 660 other victims of illness in the Pittsburgh area. Residents in seven states were sickened. In mid-November, the FDA issued a national advisory saying purchased green onions should not be eaten raw. By the end of that same month, Chi Chi’s removed green onions from its menus and temporarily closed its restaurants, later filling a lawsuit against its green onion supplier. At the same time, lawsuits by injured customers were filed against the restaurant chain with settlements reached a couple years later.

This particular outbreak would ultimately be classified as a “mixed” epidemic pattern. It began as a point-source foodborne outbreak, but it became mixed because Hepatitis A can be spread person-to-person and there were secondary infections as a result.

## Source and Cause of Contamination

An FDA trace-back investigation found that two farms in northern Mexico were the source of green onions shipped to Chi-Chi’s restaurant in late September and early October 2003. The implicated green onions were apparently contaminated with hepatitis A virus before or during packing into shipping boxes on these northern Mexico farms during September 2003. No repacking occurred between the packing sheds on the farms and delivery to Chi-Chi’s restaurant. None of the food-handling practices reported by the restaurant employees were specifically linked to transmission; however, many of these preparation practices could have resulted in cross-contamination.

## How the Outbreak was First Discovered

On November 1, 2003, an alert clinician informed the Pennsylvania Department of Health of several cases of hepatitis A among residents of Beaver County, Pennsylvania, a significant rise from the prior year when only one case of hepatitis A had been reported in the county. Six individuals who were ill recalled eating in two separate groups at a restaurant in Beaver County.

## Patient Treatments

By mid-November, as the number of infections had risen to 510, thousands of people who ate food at the restaurant or were exposed to ill persons were showing up at health clinics throughout western Pennsylvania to receive protective shots of gamma globulin. One of the infected persons required a liver transplant and was put on a ventilator after surgery due to complications, ultimately recovering after a long period of convalescence.

## Authority Response

In mid-November, the FDA launched an investigation to trace the source of the Chi-Chi’s scallions. It issued a national advisory saying purchased green onions should not be eaten raw or undercooked and temporarily halted the importation of green onions from certain farms in Mexico, including the two that supplied green onions to the restaurant at Beaver Valley Mall and others implicated in three similar recent outbreaks of hepatitis A associated with contaminated green onions in Tennessee, Georgia and North Carolina that sickened nearly 400 people. Because the hepatitis A virus is present briefly in blood before infecting the liver, the Central Blood Bank and local branch of the American Red Cross discarded blood from people who had eaten at Chi-Chi’s.

## Business Response

Chi-Chi’s at Beaver Valley, the only location of the restaurant chain where the outbreak occurred, was closed by the company on November 2, 2003, going through extensive cleaning, disinfecting, and sanitizing procedures. As a precaution, the other 99 restaurants in the chain removed scallions from their dishes. The restaurant reopened in mid-January 2004. In late July 2004, the restaurant chain filed a lawsuit against three of its green onions suppliers for compensation related to the many lawsuits filed against Chi-Chi’s by people sickened after eating at the Beaver County restaurant.

## Society Response

Many of the sickened filed lawsuits against Chi-Chi’s as early as November 2003. Class action lawsuits followed culminating with the US Bankruptcy Court in Delaware approving the proposed settlement of the class action on behalf of the approximately 9,300 persons who obtained immune globulin shots for immunization during the November 2003 hepatitis A outbreak in Beaver County, Pennsylvania. The $800,000.00 settlement fund was distributed amongst the 4,991 claimants who returned completed claim forms by the October 24, 2005 deadline.
