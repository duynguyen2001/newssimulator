# E. coli linked to contact with livestock at Fair, North Carolina, 2011

On October 24, 2011, the North Carolina Division of Public Health (NCDPH) was notified of four Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) infections among persons who had attended the 2011 North Carolina State Fair, held October 13 through 23 in Raleigh. Approximately one million visitors had attended the fair. On November 10, a livestock building, a permanent round-roofed structure where sheep, goats, and pigs were exhibited, was identified as the source of the outbreak, animal contact likely the cause of the E. coli infections suffered by 27 fairgoers.

This was a continuous common-source outbreak originating from animal contact (not foodborne).

## Source and Cause of Contamination

The North Carolina public health investigators interviewed 114 fairgoers, including the 27 who got sick. State agriculture and health officials pinpointed the building that hosted livestock competitions through a case-control study of those who were sick and 87 fairgoers who were not. The participants answered a 21-page questionnaire about their fair activities, including questions about the foods they ate and beverages they drank.

## How the Outbreak was First Discovered

The first illnesses were reported around October 15, according to the North Carolina Division of Public Health. The outbreak was found quickly because of a statewide disease surveillance system called NC DETECT that is linked to every emergency department in the state. Data related to disease patterns are tracked, and authorized public health officials can access information on the system. The system is updated daily, which made it easy to identify an uptick in people consulting doctors about bloody diarrhea, who eventually tested positive for E. coli.

## Patient Treatments

Eight of the fairgoers became so sick they required hospitalization. Three children were hospitalized and underwent dialysis for kidney failure brought on by hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS), a complication of E. coli infection, according to the Public Information Office of the North Carolina Division of Public Health.

## Authority Response

Health and agriculture officials took steps to prevent a repeat of the E. coli outbreak. Several changes in and around the three main livestock buildings were announced. Barriers were used to prevent fairgoers from getting close to livestock in some areas. Visits to the Kelley Building, identified as source of the outbreak, were barred entirely except for a few days of the fair and, in some areas, pedestrian traffic was shifted away from the animals. Food vendors were also relocated from their original place.

## Business Response

Fair organizers implemented changes in how animals were exhibited and provided the fairgoers with more opportunities to wash their hands. To increase public awareness, bolder, bigger, more prominent signs at hand washing stations were displayed at animal exhibits exit points as well as warning signs not to take food, drinks, or strollers into the animal exhibits. Traffic patterns that discourage people from touching or petting competition animals in the livestock buildings were also implemented.

## Society Response

In 2013, the family of a child who was hospitalized due to the outbreak filed a $500,000 lawsuit against the North Carolina Department of Agriculture and Conservation. The familyâ€™s attorneys said that the State failed to keep the fairgrounds safe by not sufficiently cleaning the animal holding areas inside the main building on the site, failed to provide enough hand-washing stations for the public, and failed to live up to its own specific guidelines about proper disposal of animal waste.
