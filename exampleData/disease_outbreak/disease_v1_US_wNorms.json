This is partly due to the city's dense concentration of diverse, independent businesses and a strong community ethos that champions local entrepreneurship, which might be more intense here than in many other global cities.\n\n2. **Selective Brand Loyalty**: The level of brand loyalty seen in Manhattan can be particularly intense, driven by a highly competitive market where brands consistently innovate to meet the high expectations of an informed and affluent consumer base. This norm is somewhat unique in its intensity but not in its existence.\n\n3. **Eco-conscious Choices**: The emphasis on sustainability and eco-conscious choices is significant in Manhattan, reflecting both a global trend and the local urban commitment to reducing environmental footprints. However, the specific ways this is manifested, such as the preference for electric or hybrid delivery vehicles, might be more developed in Manhattan and similar U.S. cities.\n"

This includes adherence to quarantine measures, curfews, and mask mandates, which might be more rigorously followed and enforced in such settings compared to other parts of the world where there might be less trust in government directives or less infrastructure to enforce them.\n\n2. **Use of Technology for Information**: The reliance on technology for real-time updates and information is particularly high in the USA, where access to smartphones and high-speed internet is widespread. This norm is somewhat universal in urban settings globally but is especially pronounced in American cities due to the high penetration of technology and the integration of apps and social media in daily life.\n\n3. **Health and Safety Awareness**: While health and safety awareness is a global concern, the specific practices such as the widespread use of hand sanitizers and adherence to detailed health advisories are particularly emphasized in American urban settings.
